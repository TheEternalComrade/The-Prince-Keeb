# The Prince Keeb
A 54-key, low-profile, split keyboard.

My main goal when designing The Prince Keeb was for it to be as comfortable to type on as possible. 

That meant it needed to be low profile, have a thin case, and make use of layers
as opposed to more keys.

This keyboard uses KMK for firmware. because of its unique ease of use.

Small as it may seem I think this keyboard
packs a truly <i>royal</i> experience.
