Today, I mostly focused on planning. I want this keyboard to:
- Be column staggered
- Have more convenient key placements
- Feel satisfying to type on
- Be overall more intuitive than normal keyboards.

Anaylizing my typing patterns, I notice that my hands often feel cramped, keys feel somewhat unintuitive in location, and I struggle to
hit keys like "tab" and "backspace" with my pinkie fingers. I decided that it would be best to not have a dedicated function row, and to instead have it accessible with an fn key.
With some thinking, I have made a plan for a keyboard with 52 keys. Currently, I think it'll have only 2 thumb keys per hand, but I might change that later on.
For inspiration, I looked on the internet ; especially on the Reddit sub r/ergomechkeyboards.
There, I found some designs that I want to take inspiration from

With a good idea of what I wanted to make in mind, I have started to plan out the layout for my keyboard.

Time Spent: 2.5 hours
