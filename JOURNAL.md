Today, I mostly focused on planning. I want this keyboard to:
- Be column staggered
- Have more convenient key placements
- Feel satisfying to type on
- Be overall more intuitive than normal keyboards.

Anaylizing my typing patterns, I notice that my hands often feel cramped, keys feel somewhat unintuitive in location, and I struggle to
hit keys like "tab" and "backspace" with my pinkie fingers. I decided that it would be best to not have a dedicated function row, and to instead have it accessible with an fn key.
With some thinking, I have made a plan for a keyboard with 52 keys. Currently, I think it'll have only 2 thumb keys per hand, but I might change that later on.
For inspiration, I looked on the internet ; especially on the Reddit sub r/ergomechkeyboards.
There, I found some designs that I want to take inspiration from

With a good idea of what I wanted to make in mind, I have started to plan out the layout for my keyboard.

Today, I started designing the left half of my keyboard. 
However, before that, I finished tweaking my keybaord design on [Keyboard-Layout-Editor](https://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/#/)
This is what I came up with. I've decided to increase the amount of thumb keys to 6, so this will be a
54 key keyboard.

 I also decided that I want to use low profile switches. I've tried to use normal profile keyboards in the past, but
 the height makes my wrists hurt. 
 The thing is, unlike regular profile switches, there isn't really
 a standard design for low profile switches. I had to go hunting for footprints, 3d models, hotswap sockets, etc for the Gateron
 KS-33 switches I chose to use.
 One I had my layout finalized, I
